There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Code Racer. Settle, once and for all, who is the best coder in the west.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  A game for programmers to have fun at work. Code Racer introduces a healthy amount of competition between coworkers, while increasing real, code-typing speed. And, as a secret, subconscious bonus, Code Racer exposes players to potentially unfamiliar apis.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  Code Racer is a multiplayer typing game for programmers. Typing samples will be created using a module from npm. Players will connect to the game, and when the timer starts, players start furiously typing the code which appears on the screen. When time runs out, players are presented with statistics from the race: average rate(characters/words per second/minute), total accuracy / accuracy per key, etc. Players compete with each other for the best stats each race. Not only is Code Racer fun to play, it will actually benefit the players who play consistently. Academic benefits include, but are not limited to, increased typing speed, and exposure to npm modules. Other side-effects include spontaneous teambuilding, synergistic competition, and a gluten-free happiness boost.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  Programmers who want to improve their typing speed typically turn to typing practice or games, but those usually only involve typing passages from a story. Although potentially effective, it's not the most efficient way to improve specifically coding speed. Code-specific typing sites tend to stick to self-practice, and everybody knows that doing stuff with friends is approximately 1.3 million times better than doing the same stuff alone.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  Code Racer combines the best of both worlds. Introducing typing practice as a game introduces light competition to the system, and incentivizes players to improve upon their skills. Using pre-written code as samples instead of text from a story makes prompts more relevant. Specifically, different symbols such as !, &, and * around the keyboard are very common in code, but are almost never seen in stories. End-of-game statistics alert the player to different ways they might improve their overall speed, be it raw dexterity, or accuracy, and will even make the player more aware of problem-keys. 

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "Code Racer has helped my employees to increase their typing speeds by 5%. Which makes my company 5% more productive. Which brings me 5% closer to being a bazillionnaire. Thanks Code Racer! &#128077;"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  All you have to do is start a game of Code Racer to realize your full potential.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "Before using Code Racer, I was the slowest typer at my company. Now I'm not!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
